# 🧪 AppExperiments

Welcome to **AppExperiments**, my personal playground for building and exploring native and web-based applications across desktop, mobile, and browser platforms. This project is all about honing my front-end and cross-platform app development skills — no backend involved, just pure client-side magic.

## 🧭 What You’ll Find Here

A diverse collection of small to mid-sized apps created using a variety of technologies, targeting different platforms:

- 🖥️ **Desktop apps**: Tauri, Electron, Rust GUI frameworks  
- 📱 **Mobile apps**: Flutter, React Native  
- 🌐 **Web apps**: Vanilla JS, Svelte, React, Vite, and more  

All apps are strictly **frontend-only** or **native** — no backend or server-side logic. Many are experimental or minimal, designed to test ideas and learn by building.
